# Data Analysis 

This part of the project is carried out in order to analyze and compare the distribution of the training and benchmarking data sets, which were obtained in the previous phase of the project and can be found in the `mmseq_results` directory of this repository. 
The programming tools that were used include Pandas (to create the data frames for further analysis) and Seaborn (to produce graphs that facilitate statistical data visualization).
