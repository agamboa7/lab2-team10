# Data Analysis 

This part of the project was carried out in order to analyze and compare the distribution of the training and benchmarking data sets, which were obtained in the previous phase of the project and can be found in the `mmseq_results` directory of this repository. 

The programming tools that were used include Pandas (to create the data frames for further analysis) and Seaborn (to produce graphs that facilitate statistical data visualization).

## Taxonomic Classification

We produced two pie charts (one for training set and one for test set) in order to compare the composition percentages at kingdom level in both sets. The resulting percentages are shown in the following table, showing that the distributions of kingdoms in both sets are consistent:

| Kingdom  | Train Set (%) | Test Set (%) |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| Metazoa  | 55.4          | 55.9         |
| Fungi    | 25.7          | 25.5         |
| Plants   | 17.0          | 16.6         |
| Other    | 2.0           | 1.9          |
